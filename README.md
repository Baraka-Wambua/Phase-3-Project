# H1N1 VACCINE PREDICTION.

## Project Overview
This project Uses Logistic Regression and Decision Trees Classifiers models to make predictions of whether someone received H1N1_vaccine or not.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM.
The Ministry of Health wants to administer Covid-19 vaccines but they do not know how people will respond. The ministry revisited past data with the information of vaccination cases in late 2009 and early 2010 conducted by the United States. I have been given this data and tasked to predict whether people received H1N1 vaccines according to their backgrounds,opinions and health behaviors.

## OBJECTIVES
The main objectives are:

* To predict how likely individuals are to receive H1N1_vaccine.
* To use Logistic regression modelling to make our predictions
*To model a DecisionTree that provides us with predictions
*To evaluate the performance of our models and come up with the best model.
*Provide insight of how people would react to covid-19 vaccination.

## Data Understanding
For this project, i will be using information from datasets:

* training_set_features.csv- A dataset containing personal information of individuals who responded to the survey about h1n1_vaccination.
* training_set_labels.csv - A dataset containing the label features 0 and 1. 0 for those who received vaccines and 1 for those who didn't.

## Modelling
#### Logistic Regression Modeling
I made a logistic regression model and came up with the following ROC graph and Confusion Matrix after Tuning the model.
